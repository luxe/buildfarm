## What is buildfarm?
Buildfarm is a service software stack which presents an implementation of the [Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis). This means it can be used by any client of that API to retain content `ContentAddressableStorage`, cache ActionResults by a key `ActionCache`, and execute actions asynchronously `Execution`.

Buildfarm is cross-platform and has been heavily tested with bazel as a client.

This documentation is a comprehensive description of the architecture, features, functionality, and operation, as well as a guide to a smoothly installing and running the software. Familiarity with the Remote Execution API is expected, and references to it will be provided as needed.
